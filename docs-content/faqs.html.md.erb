   * Appdynamics PCF Dashboard (An autogenerated custom dashboard, that creates healthrules for the above PCF metrics and neatly presents it)

### <a id='g3'></a> How do I configure SSL (On Prem controller deployment) ?
   *  Please make sure you have included the entire certificate chain in the security config
    of the OpsManager director tile. This will ensure that all BOSH deployments and Diego        cells has access to those certificates automatically while doing SSL validation
   *  Appdynamics deployments automatically reads the certificates, imports them into correct       key stores. No additional steps are needed.
   *  Please follow the exact format (no commnets) as specified in the Pivotal OpsManager        documentation
   *  Make sure you check the all SSL check boxes in Tile Configuration Forms

### <a id='g4'></a> How do I configure SSL (SAAS deployment)?
   *   Appdynamics SAAS controller are signed with standard   DigiCerts CA. They are already included in the BOSH deployments and applicaiton containers
   *   Just make sure you check the all SSL check boxes in Tile Configuration Forms

### <a id='g5'></a> My installation failed, what do I provide to Appdynamics support?

## <a id='PCFDashboardFAQS'></a> Appdynamics PCF Dashboard FAQs
### <a id='d1'></a> What is PCF Dashboard?
  * The PCF Dashboard Generator is a Python 3 application that generates a platform dashboard and set of health rules for PCF foundations that have installed the Appd Tile v4.4.x. The generated dashboard and health rules leverage the custom metrics published by the Appd Tile to the AppD controller and application configured in the Appd Tile

### <a id='d2'></a> Where do I find this dashboard?
 * The dashboard can be found in Dashboards and Reports page of the controller, with a name `{appname}-{tiername}-PCF KPI Dashboard`  where appname and tiername are the names of machine agent application and tier name we have configured in the tile.

### <a id='d3'></a> How is this dashboard getting created?
   * The dashboard application reads the KPI metrics emitted by machine agent in the tile and associates them with various auto generated healthrules and renders a neat custom dashboard.

### <a id='d5'></a> I dont see this dashboard, how do I troubleshoot?
   * make sure the application is deployed properly. You should see `appdpcfdashboard-version` running.
